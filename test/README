----------------------------------------------------------
Tests for the scripting that generates the svunit framework
----------------------------------------------------------
frmwrk_0: generate a basic unit test for a class
frmwrk_1: generate a basic unit test for a class with a different name than the file name
frmwrk_2: test the comment parsing with one basic unit test for a class that has a bunch of comments mixed in
frmwrk_3: test multiple classes (2) in the same file
frmwrk_4: test 2 basic unit tests for a class in different dirs with classes that are in different dirs
frmwrk_5: test one basic unit test in a child dir but none in the parent
frmwrk_6: testrunner created from 3 levels of test hierarchy
frmwrk_7: "no unit tests" message delivered and create_svunit.pl returns 1 for multi-level hierarchy without unit tests (see ticket #5)
frmwrk_8: multi-level hierarchy, class unit tests in child dirs but not the test root dir (see ticket #5)
frmwrk_9: multi-level hierarchy, class unit tests in some but not all child dirs and in the test root dir (see ticket #5)
frmwrk_10: generate a basic unit test for a module

---------------------------------
Tests for the simulator makefiles
---------------------------------
sim_vcsi_mk_0: run the framework for a single class unit test with vcsi
sim_vcsi_mk_1: run the framework for a single module unit test with vcsi
sim_vcsi_mk_2: verify virtual interface connectivity between a single module unit test and dut with vcsi
sim_qverilog_mk: run the framework for a single unit class test with qverilog
sim_not_from_pwd: verify make variables allow sims to be run from directories other than pwd
sim_not_from_pwd_multi_testsuites: same as sim_not_from_pwd except with multiple levels of hierarchy (same hierarchy as frmwrk_6)
                                   make at every level to verify the entire hierarchy runs

-------------------
SVUnit base testing
-------------------
svunit_base_0a: test the use of the svunit logging macros with vcs
svunit_base_0b: test the use of the svunit logging macros with questa
